What if exploring the codebase of a project on GitHub suddenly became more friendly.
Most peolple exploring a repository on GitHub are looking for documentation, not aiming to understand how the codebases is created and how it works under the hood.
That's somehow the hard and sad truth when it comes to open-source projects.

## The problem

When you open a repository on GitHub, you are presented with a list of files and folders.
You can click on a file and see its content, but you can't really understand what it does.
You can't see the code in context, you can't see how it's used, you can't see the documentation.
You can't see anything.

## The solution

What if you could see the code for what it means for you, as a consumer of the project?
What if you could see the code in context, as it's used in the project?
What if you could see the documentation, as it's written for you, the consumer of the project?
What if you could see all of that, in a single place, without having to navigate through the repository?

## The solution is here

GitHub Blocks is a tool that allows you to do just that.
It's a tool that allows you to see the code in context, as it's used in the project.
It's a tool that allows you to see the documentation, as it's written for you, the consumer of the project.
It's a tool that allows you to see all of that, in a single place, without having to navigate through the repository.
