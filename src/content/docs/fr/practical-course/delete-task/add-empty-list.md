## The *ngIf directive

To iterate over the tasks list, we used the `*ngFor` directive.
Known as a structural directive, it affects the layout by adding, removing, or manipulating elements in the DOM.

Another common structural directive is the `*ngIf` directive.
It allows you to conditionally display an element in the view.

By passing it a condition, the element its used one is displayed only when the condition is true.

### üéì Instructions

1. Open the `src/app/task-list.component.html` file.

2. Replace the content of the file with the following code:

```html ins={"1. Add a message when the tasks list is empty": 6-7}
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let task of tasks">
    Task name : {{ task.title }}
  </li>
</ul>

<p *ngIf="!tasks.length">No tasks to display</p>
```

## Let's test it out

1. Remove all the tasks from the list.
2. The message "No tasks to display" should be displayed in the view.
