]} />

We are able to fill out the form, but we need to get the data from the form to create a new task and add it to the existing list.

## Angular Forms API

Angular provides 2 different API to work with forms:

- Template-driven forms
- Reactive forms

In this course, we will use the template-driven forms API to bind the form.

## Template-driven forms

What does `Template-driven` mean?

The form structure and validations are defined in the HTML template. The template-driven forms are easy to use and suitable for simple forms.
On Angular side, our focus is to bind each field to a property to retrieve its current value.

## Task model

We will create a `task` model to represent a task. The `task` model will have two properties: `title` and `description`.
Its shape is different from the `Task` interface we created earlier. We'll create a new derivated one from the existing `Task` interface.

### Pick Typescript Utility type

The `Pick` utility type allows you to create a new type by picking some properties from an existing type.
The benefit of using the `Pick` utility type is that it helps you to avoid duplicating the properties of the existing type.

We pass it the original type and the properties we want to pick.

```ts
// task.model.ts
export type TaskForm = Pick<Task, 'title' | 'description'>;

```

#### üéì Instructions

1. Open the `src/app/task-form/task.model.ts` file.

2. Add the following code:

```typescript
// task.model.ts
export type TaskForm = Pick<Task, 'title' | 'description'>;
```

3. Open the `src/app/task-form/task-form.component.ts` file.

4. Replace the content of the file with the following code:

```typescript ins={"Import the new TaskForm type": 3-4} ins={"Add the task model with empty values": 12-16}
// task-form.component.ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

import {TaskForm} from '../model/task.model';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-task-form',
  templateUrl: './task-form.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./task-form.component.css']
})
export class TaskFormComponent implements OnInit {
    
  task: TaskForm = {
    title: '',
    description: ''
  };
    
  ngOnInit() {}  
}
```

## Form binding

To bind a form to a model in Angular, you can use the `[ngModel]` directive.
The `[ngModel]` directive is a built-in directive that allows you to bind a form input to a model.
But it won't be enough for our usecase: it only allows us to bind the value of the property to the field, not the other way around.

### 2 way data binding

To update our `task` model when the form is updated, we need to use the `[(ngModel)]` format.
Also called **banana in a box** syntax to remember how to write it, it allows us to:

- bind the value of the task to the form field
- to update the value of the task based on the user input

We want to bind the `title` input to the `task.title` property and the `description` textarea to the `task.description` property.

#### üéì Instructions

1. Open the `src/app/task-form/task-form.component.html` file.

2. Replace the content of the file with the following code:

```html ins={"Bind the title with the ngModel directive": 4-5} ins="[(ngModel)]="task.title"" ins={"Bind the description with the ngModel directive": 8-9} ins="[(ngModel)]="task.description""
// task-form.component.html
<form>
  <label for="title" class="form-label">Title</label>
    
  <input type="text" id="title" name="title" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="task.title">
    
  <label for="description" class="form-label">Description</label>
    
  <textarea id="description" name="description" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]="task.description"></textarea>
  
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Create task</button>
</form>
```

By being bound to the form, the `task` model will be updated when the form is updated.
