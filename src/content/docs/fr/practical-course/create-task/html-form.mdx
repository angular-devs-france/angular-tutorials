## Form structure

To create a form in HTML, you need to use the `<form>` tag.

The `<form>` tag is used to create an HTML form for user input.

The form can contain input elements like text fields, checkboxes, radio-buttons, submit buttons, and more.


The Task form will have the following fields:

- Task title
- Task description

:::note
The **Task** interface includes 2 more properties: `id` and `createdAt`.
Their values will be generated upon the form submission later on by the application, not the user.
:::

The form also includes a submit button to create the new task based on the form values.

#### üéì Instructions

1. Open the `src/app/task-form/task-form.component.html` file.

2. Replace the content of the file with the following code:

```html ins={"Add an input for the task title with its label": 3-5} ins={"Add a textarea for the task description with its label": 7-9} ins={"Add a submit button": 11-12}
// task-form.component.html
<form>

  <label for="title" class="form-label">Title</label>
  <input type="text" id="title" name="title" class="form-control">
  
  
  <label for="description" class="form-label">Description</label>
  <textarea id="description" name="description" class="form-control"></textarea>
  
  
  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Create task</button>
</form>
```
