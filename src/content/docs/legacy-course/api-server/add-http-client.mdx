## HttpClient Module

The **HttpClientModule** is a built-in Angular module that allows you to send HTTP requests to a server.
It provides an **HttpClient** service that you can inject into your services to make HTTP requests.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Import **HttpClientModule** in the `src/app/app.module.ts` file.

   ```typescript ins={"Import HttpClientModule": 3-4} ins={"Add HttpClientModule to the imports array": 13-14}
   import { BrowserModule } from "@angular/platform-browser";
   import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";

   import { HttpClientModule } from "@angular/common/http";
   import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";

   @NgModule({
     declarations: [AppComponent],
     imports: [BrowserModule, HttpClientModule],
     providers: [],
     bootstrap: [AppComponent],
   })
   export class AppModule {}
   ```

2. Inject the HttpClient service in the `src/app/task.service.ts` file.

   ```typescript ins={"Import the HttpClient service": 2-3} ins={"Inject the HttpClient service": 9-11}
   import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

   import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: "root",
   })
   export class TaskService {
     constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you have learned

**HttpClientModule** is a built-in Angular module that allows you to send HTTP requests to a server.
It's one of the first modules added to a real Angular application to communicate with a server.
In the next chapters, we'll use it to communicate with the mock API server to retrieve and update tasks.
