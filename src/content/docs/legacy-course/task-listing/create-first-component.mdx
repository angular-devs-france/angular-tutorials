## Angular CLI

You've already used the CLI to run our application locally with the `ng serve` command in the <a href="/legacy-course/getting-started/#running-the-application" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> section. Now use it to create a new component!

The Angular CLI provides a command to generate a new component using `ng generate component component-name`.
You can also use the shorthand command `ng g c component-name`.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in a terminal to generate a new component called `task-list`

   ```bash
   ng generate component task-list
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   ng g c task-list
   ```

2. Look for a new folder called `task-list` in the `src/app` directory.

</Steps>

:::note
This new folder contains the following three files:

- `task-list.component.ts` (model)
- `task-list.component.html` (view)
- `task-list.component.css` (style)

This is the same structure as the AppComponent.
:::

## Component Metadata

When opening the `task-list.component.ts` file, you can see the following code:

```typescript
// task-list.component.ts
@Component({
  selector: "app-task-list",
  templateUrl: "./task-list.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./task-list.component.css"],
})
export class TaskListComponent {}
```

The **@Component** decorator defines the component's configuration metadata.
This is where we determine how the component should be processed, instantiated, and used at runtime.

The **selector** property defines the component's HTML tag name.
By using this selector in an HTML Template (view), Angular creates and displays an instance of the component.

The **templateUrl** property defines the location of the HTML Template (its view) for the component.
This is the view that will be displayed when the CSS **selector** is used in another HTML Template.

The **styleUrls** property defines the locations of the component's CSS files.
These styles will be applied to the component's template.

:::note
A decorator is a way to do meta-programming. They can modify their target (classes, methods, ...), call other methods when the target is called, or add metadata intended for a framework. This last point corresponds to how we use them in Angular.
:::

## Display the Component

So far, the application only displays the HTML content of the **app** component in the browser.
You've generated the new component but you need to display its HTML content using its selector.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Open the `src/app/app.component.html` file.

2. Add the task list component selector as follows:

   ```html ins={"Add the component selector (and the <main> tag for proper HTML semantics and CSS management)": 5-8}
   // app.component.html
   <header class="navbar bg-body-tertiary px-4">
     <h1 class="navbar-brand fw-bold">Angular Legacy course</h1>
   </header>

   <main class="container pt-4">
     <app-task-list />
   </main>
   ```

3. Check the changes in your browser.

   <Image
     class="shadow-xl rounded-xl"
     src={creationImg}
     alt="A bird sitting on a nest of eggs."
   />

</Steps>

:::tip
`task-list works!` appears in the browser.
This is the default content generated by the Angular CLI in the component's HTML Template. You will update it in the upcoming chapters.

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you've learned

In this chapter, you learned how to create a new component using the Angular CLI and use it in your application.

You also remembered that the component's **view** is its HTML Template and the component's **model** is its TypeScript file.
