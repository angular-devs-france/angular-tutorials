## Form Structure

To create a form in HTML, you need to use the `<form>` tag.

The `<form>` tag is used to create an HTML form for user input.

The form can contain input elements such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.

The form to create a task will have the following fields:

- Task title
- Task description

:::note
The **Task** interface includes 2 additional properties: **id** and **createdAt**.
Their values will be generated later when the form is submitted by the application and not by the user.
:::

The form also includes a submit button to create the new task based on the form values.

### üéì Instructions

     <input type="text" id="title" name="title" class="form-control" />
