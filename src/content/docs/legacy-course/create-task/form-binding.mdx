Currently, the form input is possible. Now, you need to retrieve the form data to create a new task and add it to the existing list.

## Angular Forms API

Angular provides 2 different APIs for working with forms:

- Template-driven Forms
- Reactive Forms

In this course, you will use the Template-driven Forms API to bind the form.

## Template-driven Forms

What does **Template-driven** mean?

The form structure and validations are defined in the view (HTML Template). Template-driven forms are easy to use and suitable for simple forms.
On the Angular side, our goal is to bind each field to a property to get its current value.

## TaskForm Type

You will create a new **TaskForm** type to represent a task form. The **TaskForm** type will have two properties: **title** and **description**.
Its shape is different from the **Task** interface you created earlier. You will create a new one derived from the existing **Task** interface.

### Choose the TypeScript Utility Type

The TypeScript utility type **Pick** allows you to create a new type by selecting certain properties from an existing type.
The advantage of using the **Pick** utility type is that it helps you avoid duplicating properties from the existing type.

You pass it the original type and the properties you want to select.

```ts
// task.model.ts
export type TaskForm = Pick<Task, "title" | "description">;
```

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Open the file `src/app/models/task.model.ts`.

2. Add the following code below the existing one:

   ```typescript
   // task.model.ts
   export type TaskForm = Pick<Task, "title" | "description">;
   ```

3. Import the forms functionality in Angular with the **FormsModule**

   ```typescript ins={"Import FormsModule": 3-4} ins={"Add FormsModule to the imports array": 16-17}
   // app.module.ts
   import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";

   import { FormsModule } from "@angular/forms";

   @NgModule({
     declarations: [AppComponent, TaskListComponent, TaskFormComponent],
     imports: [BrowserModule, AppRoutingModule, NgbModule, FormsModule],
     providers: [],
     bootstrap: [AppComponent],
   })
   export class AppModule {}
   ```

4. Modify the file `src/app/task-form/task-form.component.ts`.

   ```typescript ins={"Import the new TaskForm type": 3-4} ins={"Add the task variable with empty values": 12-16}
   // task-form.component.ts
   import { Component } from "@angular/core";

   import { TaskForm } from "../model/task.model";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-task-form",
     templateUrl: "./task-form.component.html",
     styleUrls: ["./task-form.component.css"],
   })
   export class TaskFormComponent {
     task: TaskForm = {
       title: "",
       description: "",
     };
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## Form Binding

To bind a form to your new **task** variable in Angular, you can use the `[ngModel]` directive.
The `[ngModel]` directive is a built-in directive that allows you to bind a form input to a variable.
But this won't be enough for your use case: it only allows you to bind the property value to the field, not update the variable based on user input.

### Two-way Data Binding

To update your **task** variable when the form is updated, you need to use the `[(ngModel)]` format.
This syntax allows us to:

- bind the task value to the form field;
- update the task value based on user input.

`[(ngModel)]` ü§î `([ngModel])` ? To remember the order of parentheses and brackets?

Now, you need to bind the **title** input to the **task.title** property and the **description** textarea to the **task.description** property.

### üéì Instructions

1. Open the file `src/app/task-form/task-form.component.html`.

2. Replace the file content with the following code:

```html ins={"Bind the title with ngModel directive": 4-5} ins="[(ngModel)]="task.title"" ins={"Bind the description with ngModel directive": 8-9} ins="[(ngModel)]="task.description""
// task-form.component.html
<form>
  <label for="title" class="form-label">Title</label>

  <input
    type="text"
    id="title"
    name="title"
    class="form-control"
    [(ngModel)]="task.title"
  />

  <label for="description" class="form-label">Description</label>

  <textarea
    id="description"
    name="description"
    class="form-control"
    [(ngModel)]="task.description"
  ></textarea>

  <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Submit</button>
</form>
```

By being bound to the form, the **task** variable will be updated when the form is updated.
