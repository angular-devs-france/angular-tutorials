## Remove the tasks list from TaskListComponent

The **TaskListComponent** class is still using its own tasks list.
You need it to use the service's list instead. The first step is to remove the tasks list from the **TaskListComponent** class.

:::caution
As you remove this list, the application will stop working (it won't compile) temporarily because the HTML Template is still expecting a **tasks** variable.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Remove the **tasks** variable from the `src/app/task-list.component.ts` file.

   ```typescript del={"Remove the tasks list": 8-22}
   // task-list.component.ts
   @Component({
     selector: "app-task-list",
     templateUrl: "./task-list.component.html",
     styleUrls: ["./task-list.component.css"],
   })
   export class TaskListComponent {
     tasks: Task[] = [
       {
         id: uuid(),
         title: "Task 1",
         description: "Description of task 1",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
       {
         id: uuid(),
         title: "Task 2",
         description: "Description of task 2",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
     ];
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## Inject TaskService

Your **TaskListComponent** class needs to use **TaskService** to get the tasks list.
Angular uses the dependency injection system to provide **TaskService** to the **TaskListComponent** class.

The **TaskService** class is prefixed with the **@Injectable()** decorator. This decorator tells Angular that the **TaskService** class can be injected into other classes.

To do this, you will reference the **TaskService** class in the **TaskListComponent** class constructor.

```ts
constructor(private taskService: TaskService) {}
```

You can now use the **taskService** variable to access the tasks list and initialize a local variable with the tasks list.

```ts
tasks: Task[] = this.taskService.tasks;
```

### üéì Instructions

1. Modify the `src/app/task-list.component.ts` file.

```typescript ins={"Import TaskService": 3-4} ins={"Create a tasks variable and initialize it with TaskService's list": 12-13} ins={"Inject TaskService in the class constructor": 15-16}
// task-list.component.ts
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

import { TaskService } from "../task.service";

@Component({
  selector: "app-task-list",
  templateUrl: "./task-list.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./task-list.component.css"],
})
export class TaskListComponent {
  tasks: Task[] = this.taskService.tasks;

  constructor(private taskService: TaskService) {}
}
```

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you have learned

You have learned how to inject a service into a component using Angular's dependency injection system.
It makes your service accessible in the component and allows you to use the service's methods and properties.
