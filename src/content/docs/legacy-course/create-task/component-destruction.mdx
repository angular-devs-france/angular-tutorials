When you submit the form, the **task** property of **TaskFormComponent** is populated with the values you entered in the form.
For example, given that you filled in the name and description fields, the **task** property will be:

```typescript
task = {
  title: "My new task",
  description: "Your nice description.",
};
```

By submitting the form and navigating to a new page, you also leave the **TaskFormComponent**.
When you leave a component, it is destroyed.

Thus, when navigating back to this form, the **task** property will be empty:

```typescript
task = {
  title: "",
  description: "",
};
```

A new instance of the **TaskFormComponent** is created each time you access it.
Therefore, any local state you define in the component is lost when you navigate to another route.

:::tip
This is why you use the **TaskService** to store the new task.
The service is a singleton, meaning it's a unique instance shared across the application.
Unless you force the application to reload in the browser, the tasks you've added will be preserved.
