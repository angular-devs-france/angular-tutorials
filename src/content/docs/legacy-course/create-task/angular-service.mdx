## Current Situation

You have 2 components in your application: **TaskFormComponent** and **TaskListComponent**.
The **TaskFormComponent** is responsible for creating new tasks.
The **TaskListComponent** is responsible for displaying the list of tasks.

Creating a new task means adding it to the task list.
However, **TaskFormComponent** and **TaskListComponent** are not connected.

We need a third party to manage the items and share them between the two components.
This is where Angular services come in!

## Angular Services

In Angular, a service is a class that can be used to share data and functionality between different parts of your application.
Services are used to encapsulate logic that isn't directly related to a specific component.
This is our situation: tasks are not directly tied to either **TaskFormComponent** or **TaskListComponent** but are shared by both components.

For the rest of this course, Angular services will be our main orchestration tool for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting tasks.

The first objective will be to store the list to make it accessible from both components.
By default, Angular services are singletons. This means there is only one instance of the service in the application.
As long as you don't refresh your application, the service will **maintain** its memory.

Since Angular routing doesn't refresh the page, the service will keep the task list in memory when switching between **TaskFormComponent** and **TaskListComponent**.

## Creating a Service

To create a service in Angular, you can use the Angular CLI.
The `ng generate` command that you used for components can also be used to generate services.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in a terminal:

   ```bash
   ng generate service task
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   ng g s task
   ```

   This command will create a new file called `task.service.ts` in the `src/app` folder.

2. Open the `task.service.ts` file and add a property to store the task list:

   ```typescript ins={"Import the task interface": 3-4} ins={"import uuid": 5-6} ins={"Add the tasks variable": 12-26}
   // task.service.ts
   import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

   import { Task } from "./models/task.model";

   import { v4 as uuid } from "uuid";

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: "root",
   })
   export class TaskService {
     tasks: Task[] = [
       {
         id: uuid(),
         title: "Task 1",
         description: "Description of task 1",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
       {
         id: uuid(),
         title: "Task 2",
         description: "Description of task 2",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
     ];
   }
   ```

</Steps>

This list is exactly the same as the one we used in **TaskListComponent** to display the tasks.

## ‚úîÔ∏è What You've Learned

In this chapter, you learned how to create a service with Angular CLI.
Services are used to share data and functionality between different parts of your application.
Not only do they help keep your code maintainable by following the DRY principle ("Don't Repeat Yourself"), but they also help keep your components clean and focused on their main purpose.
