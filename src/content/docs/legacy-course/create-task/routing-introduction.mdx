## What is routing?

Routing is the process of determining what content to display based on the browser's URL.
Angular is a Single Page Application (SPA) framework. By using the Router API, the application can display different content without completely reloading the page.

The project currently only displays the **TaskListComponent**.
The Router will enable switching between this component and the new **TaskFormComponent**.

The Router API is provided by the `@angular/forms` package.
It's installed in any new Angular project by default and you cand find it in the pckage.json file.

## Router-outlet directive

The **Router** API provides a directive called `router-outlet`. outed content will be displayed. When the user navigates to a different route, the content of the `router-outlet` is replaced with the content of the new route.
The `router-outlet` directive's only role is to mark the location in the HTML Template where the content corresponding to the URL you defined will be displayed.

### üéì Instructions

1. Modify the `src/app/app.component.html` file.

   ```html ins={"Add the directive via the router-outlet tag to mark the location of the content configured via URL": 6-7}
   <header>
     <h1>Angular Legacy course</h1>
   </header>

   <main class="container pt-4">

     <router-outlet />
   </main>
   ```

In the above case, the `router-outlet` is placed between the `<main>` tags. This means that you will continue to display the `<header>` on top of all pages and the configured content will change based on the URL you navigate to.

## Define routes

To display the desired content based on the URL, you need to add a `path` to each of your `component`s in your `routes` array:

```typescript
{ path: 'add-task', component: TaskFormComponent }
```

The path is therefore the URL that the user will access. For example, the path `/add-task` means that the user will navigate to the URL `http://localhost:4200/add-task`.

The provided component is the component that will be displayed in the `router-outlet` placeholder when the user accesses this URL.

The route definition resides in the `app-routing.module.ts` file.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Modify the `src/app/app-routing.module.ts` file.

   ```typescript ins={"Import components for each route": 4-6} ins={"Define the routes": 9-11}
   // app-routing.module.ts
   import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
   import { Routes, RouterModule } from "@angular/router";

   import { TaskListComponent } from "./task-list/task-list.component";
   import { TaskFormComponent } from "./task-form/task-form.component";

   const routes: Routes = [
     { path: "", component: TaskListComponent },
     { path: "add-task", component: TaskFormComponent },
   ];

   @NgModule({
     imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
     exports: [RouterModule],
   })
   export class AppRoutingModule {}
   ```

</Steps>

## Add links to navigate between routes

You need to add links to trigger navigation between different routes.
You could manually modify the URL in the browser, but users expect to have clickable links to navigate between pages.

The HTML `<a>` tag is used to create links and is associated with the **routerLink** directive to use Angular routing. This directive takes the path of the route to navigate to as a value.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Modify the `src/app/app.component.html` file.

   ```html ins={"Add links to navigate between routes": 4-6}
   // app.component.html
   <header>
     <h1 class="navbar-brand fw-bold">Angular Legacy course</h1>

     <a class="btn btn-light" routerLink="/">Task List</a>
     <a class="btn btn-light" routerLink="/add-task">Add new task</a>
   </header>

   <main class="container pt-4">
     <router-outlet />
   </main>
   ```

2. Click on both links to see the content of `TaskListComponent` and `TaskFormComponent` displayed alternately at the location defined by the `router-outlet`.

</Steps>

:::tip
The path of the **TaskFormComponent** is defined as `add-task` in the `app-routing.module.ts` file. However, in the HTML Template, in the **routerLink** directive, it is specified as `/add-task` (with the `/`).

**routerLink** builds the URL relative to the current path. Adding a slash indicates that the URL should be built from the base URL of the application (here `http://localhost:4200`). Without specifying the slash in the **routerLink** directive, you would create nesting and navigate to `/add-task/add-task`.

> `<a routerLink="/add-task">...</a>` => http://localhost:4200/add-task
> `<a routerLink="add-task">...</a>` => http://localhost:4200/add-task/add-task

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you have learned

In this chapter, you learned how to add routing to your application. You learned how to define routes and navigate between them using the **routerLink** directive. You also learned how to display the content of the current route using the `router-outlet` directive.
