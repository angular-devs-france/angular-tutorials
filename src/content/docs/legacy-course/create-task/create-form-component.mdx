## Creating Components

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>
1. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    ng generate component task-form
    ```

    or the short version

    ```bash
    ng g c task-form
    ```

2. You should see a new folder called **task-form** in the `src/app` directory.
</Steps>

## Angular CLI Options

The Angular CLI provides several options to customize the component generation process.
You can add these options when running the previous command. For example, to avoid generating a component in a new folder, you can run the following command:

```bash
ng generate component task-form --flat
```

or

```bash
ng g c task-form --flat
```

If you want certain options to be set by default for all components, you can add them to the `angular.json` file located at the root of your project.

For the current project, we have already defined the following options:

```json
"@schematics/angular:component": {
  "skipTests": true,
  "standalone": false
},
```

This avoids creating test files and disables the new **Standalone** feature.
These options were added to the `angular.json` file when we created the project with the Angular CLI.

> In this workshop, you won't cover knowledge about testing. This will be an important topic to develop later.

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you have learned

You used the Angular CLI to create a new component. This is the second component you've created in this project.
Such an action is common in Angular development, and the Angular CLI makes this process easier and more efficient.
If needed, you can customize the component generation process with Angular CLI options.
