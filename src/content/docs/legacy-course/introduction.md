:::caution
This course was designed with **Angular v14** and does not cover the latest versions.
It is intended to help beginners integrate into older Angular projects. Excellent features have been added to Angular since v14, but they have a different impact on how applications are built.
Our goal is to help you feel comfortable integrating into older projects.

**We will soon publish a new course for the latest version of Angular.**
