You've just learned how to delete a task from the list, now you want to display a message when the list is empty.

## The \*ngIf directive

To iterate over the task list, you used the **\*ngFor** directive.
This is a structural directive: it allows you to add, remove, or manipulate DOM elements.

Another structural directive is the **\*ngIf** directive.
It allows you to condition the display of an element in the view.

By giving it a condition, the element is only built and displayed if the condition is true.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Modify the file `src/app/task-list.component.html`.

   ```html ins={"1. Add a message when the list is empty": 9-10}
   <tr *ngFor="let task of tasks">
     <td>{{ task.title }}</td>
     <td>{{ task.createdAt | date }}</td>
     <td>
       <a class="btn btn-primary" [routerLink]="['/update', task.id]">Update</a>
       <button
         class="btn btn-danger"
         type="button"
         (click)="deleteTask(task.id)"
       >
         Delete
       </button>
     </td>
   </tr>

   <p *ngIf="!tasks.length">No tasks</p>
