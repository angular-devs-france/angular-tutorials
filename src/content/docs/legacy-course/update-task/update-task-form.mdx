import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import Objective from "../../../../../components/learning-objective.astro";

<Objective
  class="drop-shadow-xl"
  objectives={[
    {
      mainTitle: "Chapter Objectives",
      title: "Fill the form with existing data",
      description: "Learn how to populate a form with existing task data.",
    },
  ]}
/>

You can now access the **TaskFormComponent** by clicking the `Update` link.
This path includes a dynamic value to pass the **id** of the task to update.

The **TaskFormComponent** form is currently empty because it was created to add a new task and is therefore initialized as an empty form.

```typescript
// task-form.component.ts
task = {
  id: "",
  title: "",
  description: "",
};
```

Update it to use the form for both creating and updating a task.

## Retrieve task information to update with TaskService

Before getting the route identifier, let's prepare the logic to identify the task to update.
Since the task list is stored in **TaskService**, you'll add a new function to retrieve a task based on its **id**.
From this identifier, you'll get the task to fill the form.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task-service.ts`.

   ```typescript ins={"Add a function to retrieve a task by its identifier": 28-31}
   import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
   import { Task } from "./task.model";

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: "root",
   })
   export class TaskService {
     tasks: Task[] = [
       {
         title: "Task 1",
         description: "Description of task 1",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
       {
         title: "Task 2",
         description: "Description of task 2",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
     ];

     addTask(task: Task): void {
       this.tasks.push({
         ...task,
         createdAt: new Date(),
       });
     }

     getTask(id: string): Task {
       return this.tasks.find((task) => task.id === id)!;
     }
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## Get the task identifier from the route

The **id** is present in the route path, you need to retrieve it in the **TaskFormComponent**.
Use the **ActivatedRoute** service to get the **id** from the route.

This service provides access to information about the current route.
As you did with the **Router**, you'll inject it into the **TaskFormComponent** constructor.

### Hooks: Angular lifecycle

Until now, you've initialized class properties during their declaration.

For example, you initialized the **task** property with an empty object:

```typescript
task = {
  id: "",
  title: "",
  description: "",
};
```

You can't use such logic to initialize the **task** property with the task to update because this `id` isn't yet available when the Component class is created.

Why?

From creation to destruction, a component goes through several stages.
When creating the Component class, route information is not yet available.

To handle such a case, Angular provides lifecycle hooks.
Lifecycle hooks are methods that Angular calls in components and directives when it creates, changes, and destroys them.

One of the most used lifecycle hooks is **ngOnInit**, which is already present in all created components of the application.
This hook is called right after Angular has instantiated the Component class.
And at this point, the component is able to read route information.

Inside this hook, start by retrieving the route identifier.

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
    const id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
}
```

**route.snapshot** is a static image of route information and exposes a **paramMap** property.

This **paramMap** is a map of required and optional parameters specific to the route, including the dynamic route path parameters.
The **get** method of the **paramMap** object allows us to retrieve the value of a parameter based on the name you used in the route path definition: **id**.

Then, you'll retrieve the task to update from the **TaskService** based on the **id** available in the route.

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
      const id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
      this.task = this.taskService.getTask(id);
  }
```

:::tip
The **TaskFormComponent** is used for both creating and updating a task.
You should test if the **id** is available in the route before retrieving the task to update.
This will prevent an error when the **id** is not available in the route.
:::

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
      const id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');

      if (id) {
          this.task = this.taskService.getTask(id);
      }
}
```

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task-form/task-form.component.ts`.

   ```typescript ins={"inject ActivatedRoute": 20-21} ins={"Retrieve the task identifier from the route": 23-30}
   import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
   import { ActivatedRoute } from "@angular/router";
   import { TaskService } from "../task.service";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-task-form",
     templateUrl: "./task-form.component.html",
     styleUrls: ["./task-form.component.css"],
   })
   export class TaskFormComponent implements OnInit {
     task = {
       id: "",
       title: "",
       description: "",
     };

     constructor(
       private taskService: TaskService,
       private router: Router,
       private route: ActivatedRoute
     ) {}

     ngOnInit() {
       const id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get("id");

       if (id) {
         this.task = this.taskService.getTask(id);
       }
     }
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## Test it

<Steps>
  1. Click the `Update` button next to a task in the list. 2. The form should be
  filled with the task to update.
</Steps>

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you've learned

In this chapter, you learned how to update **TaskFormComponent** to fill the form with the task to update. You learned how to retrieve the task from **TaskService** based on the **id** available in the route.
