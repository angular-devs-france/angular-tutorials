## Route Configuration

So far, you have defined 2 route paths:

- `''` for the **TaskListComponent** to display the list of tasks
- `'add-task'` for the **AddTaskComponent** to display a form

The update path is quite different because you don't just want to go to a new page. To update a task, you need to know which task to update.

A common way to provide information to a routed component is to use a dynamic routing path.

## Create the Route

The new path will be `update/:id`.
The `update` part is static but the `:id` part is dynamic.

:::tip
The `:id` part is a route parameter.
You can chain multiple route parameters in a path, for example `'update/:id/:name'`.
Each is prefixed with a colon `:` followed by an arbitrarily chosen name.
:::

You won't create a dedicated component for the update functionality.
The purpose of **TaskFormComponent** is to create tasks with user input and update them.
Let's update the component to handle both creation and updating.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/app-routing.module.ts`.

   ```typescript ins={"1. Add the route for the update task feature": 9-10}
   import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
   import { RouterModule, Routes } from "@angular/router";
   import { TaskListComponent } from "./task-list/task-list.component";
   import { TaskFormComponent } from "./task-form/task-form.component";

   const routes: Routes = [
     { path: "", component: TaskListComponent },
     { path: "add-task", component: TaskFormComponent },

     { path: "update/:id", component: TaskFormComponent },
   ];

   @NgModule({
     imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
     exports: [RouterModule],
   })
   export class AppRoutingModule {}
   ```

</Steps>

## Update the Navigation

Add a link in the **TaskListComponent** to access the **TaskFormComponent** with the **id** of the task to update.
By accessing this path, you will extract the **id** value from the URL in the next chapter.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task-list/task-list.component.html`.

   ```html ins={"1. Add an update button": 4-5}
   <tr *ngFor="let task of tasks">
     <td>{{ task.title }}</td>
     <td>{{ task.createdAt | date }}</td>

     <td>
       <a class="btn btn-primary" [routerLink]="['/update', task.id]">Update</a>
     </td>
   </tr>
   ```

</Steps>

The **routerLink** value expects a string or an array of URL segments.
The first is a string, the static part of the path.
The second is the **id** of the task to update.

## Test it

<Steps>

1. Click the 'Update' button on the first task in the list.
2. Check the URL: `http://localhost:4200/update/d8ecfcda-ef70-420f-8236-3138ff64ac9f` for example.
3. The **TaskFormComponent** form is displayed correctly.

</Steps>

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you have learned

In this chapter, you learned how to add a route to update a task in an Angular application. You learned how to define a dynamic routing path to pass the **id** of the task to update. You also learned how to use the **routerLink** directive to access the **TaskFormComponent** and pass the **id** of the task to update.
