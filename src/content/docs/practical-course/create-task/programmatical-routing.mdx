In the last step, you tested the form with this scenario:

1. Click on the `Add a new task` link
2. Enter a title and a description in the form
3. Click on the `Create task` button
4. Click on the `List of tasks` link

But what if you want to redirect the user to the list of tasks after the form is submitted?
That's a common scenario in web applications, and Angular provides a way to do that.

You saw how to trigger a navigation by clicking on a link with the `routerLink` directive.
But in our situation, you want to trigger a navigation when the `createTask` function is called.

## Inject the Router

Your `TaskService` service is not the only element you can inject in the constructor of a component.
By using the Angular Router feature, you can inject the `Router` service in a component.

This service provides information about the current route and allows you to navigate to a different one.

### üéì Instructions

1. Update the `src/app/task-form.component.ts` file.

    ```typescript ins={"1. import the Router": 4-5} ins={"2. Inject the Router in the class constructor": 20-21} ins={"3. Use the navigate function from the Router": 28-29}
    // task-form.component.ts
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    import { TaskService } from '../task.service';

    import { Router } from '@angular/router';

    @Component({
        selector: 'app-task-form',
        templateUrl: './task-form.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./task-form.component.css']
    })
    export class TaskFormComponent implements OnInit {
        task = {
            title: '',
            description: ''
        };

        constructor(
            private taskService: TaskService,

            private router: Router
        ) { }

        ngOnInit() {}

        createTask() {
            this.taskService.addTask(this.task);

            this.router.navigate(['/']);
        }
    }
    ```

</Steps>

The navigate function expects an array of route segments as a parameter.
In our case, you want to navigate to the `tasks` route as you defined it in our route definition, so you use `['/']`;

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: TaskListComponent },
  { path: 'add-task', component: TaskFormComponent }
];
```

## Let's test it out

Now if you repeat the previous scenario:

1. Click on the `Add a new task` link
2. Enter a title and a description in the form
3. Click on the `Create task` button

You should be redirected to the list of tasks.

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you learned

In this chapter, you learned how to use programmatical routing in an Angular application. You learned how to inject the `Router` service in a component and use its `navigate` function to navigate to a different route.
