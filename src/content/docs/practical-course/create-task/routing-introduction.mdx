## What is routing?

Routing is the process of determining what content to display based on the URL.
Angular is a single-page application (SPA) framework. By changing the URL, the application can display different content without reloading the page.
It provides a **Router** API to change the content based on the URL.

The project currently displays a list of tasks.
We want to be able to switch between displaying this list or the form to add a new task.

## Router outlet

The Angular **RouterModule** provides a directive called `router-outlet`. This directive is used to display the content of the current route. When the user navigates to a different route, the content of the `router-outlet` is replaced with the content of the new route.
This `router-outlet` is a placeholder for our content.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/app.component.html` file.

    ```html ins={"Add router-outlet as a placeholder for routed content": 6-7}
    <header>
        <h1>Angular Practical course</h1>
    </header>

    <main class="container pt-4">

        <router-outlet />
    </main>
    ```

</Steps>

As the `router-outlet`is a placeholder, it means we'll keep seeing the header on all pages, but the content of the `router-outlet` will change based on the URL.

## Define the routes

We need to define the routes for our application. Each route is defined by a path and a component as an object :

```typescript
{ path: '/add-task', component: TaskFormComponent }
```

The path is the URL that the user will navigate to. For example `/add-task` path means that the user will navigate to `http://localhost:4200/add-task`.

The component provided is the component that will be displayed in the `router-outlet` placeholder when the user navigates to that URL.

The route definition lies in the `app-routing.module.ts` file.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/app-routing.module.ts` file.

    ```typescript ins={"Import the components for each route": 4-6} ins={"Define the routes": 9-11}
    // app-routing.module.ts
    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
    import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

    import { TaskListComponent } from './task-list/task-list.component';
    import { TaskFormComponent } from './task-form/task-form.component';

    const routes: Routes = [

      { path: '', component: TaskListComponent },
      { path: 'add-task', component: TaskFormComponent }
    ];

    @NgModule({
      imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
      exports: [RouterModule]
    })
    export class AppRoutingModule { }
    ```

</Steps>


## Add links to navigate between routes

We need to add links to trigger the navigation between the different routes.
We could manually change the URL in the browser but users expect to have clickables links to navigate between pages.

The `<a>` HTMl tag is used to create links and is associated to the **routerLink** directive to trigger Angular routing. This directive take the path of the route to navigate to as a value.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/app.component.html` file.

    ```html ins={"Add links to navigate between routes": 4-6}
    // app.component.html
    <header>
        <h1>Angular Practical course</h1>

        <a routerLink="/">List of tasks</a>
        <a routerLink="/add-task">Add a new task</a>
    </header>

    <main class="container pt-4">
        <router-outlet />
    </main>
    ```


2. Click on both links to see the content of the `TaskListComponent` and `TaskFormComponent` displayed in the `router-outlet`.

</Steps>

:::tip
The **TaskFormComponent** path is defined as `add-task` in the `app-routing.module.ts` file, but used as `/add-task` in the **routerLink** directive.
It's used to change the URL at the root of the URL. Without it, the navigation would be relative to the current URL: if you are already on `/add-task`, the link would try to navigate to `/add-task/add-task`.
