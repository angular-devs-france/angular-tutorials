## Component creation

### 🎓 Instructions

<Steps>
1. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    ng generate component task-form
    ```

    or the shorthand version:

    ```bash
    ng g c task-form
    ```

2. You should see a new folder called `task-form` in the `src/app` folder.

</Steps>

## Angular CLI options

The Angular CLI provides multiple options to customize the component generation process.
You can add these options upon the previous command. For example, to avoid generating a component in a new folder, you can run the following command:

```bash
ng generate component task-form --flat
```

If you want some options to be the default for all components, you can add them to the `angular.json` file located at the root of your project.
For the current project, we already have the following options set:

```json
"@schematics/angular:component": {
  "skipTests": true,
  "standalone": false
},
```

It avoids creating test files and deactivate the new **Standalone** feature.
These options were added to the `angular.json` file when we created the project with the Angular CLI.

> This course doesn't cover testing, that's a topic for another course.

## ✔️ What you learned

We used the Angular CLI to create a new component. That's the second component we created in this project.
Such a task is a common task in Angular development, and the Angular CLI makes it easy to create new components.
If needed, you can customize the component generation process with the Angular CLI options.

## 🚦 Quiz
