## The problem

We have 2 components in our application: `TaskFormComponent` and `TaskListComponent`.
The `TaskFormComponent` is responsible for creating new tasks.
The `TaskListComponent` is responsible for displaying the list of tasks.

Creating a new task implies adding it to the list of tasks.
But the `TaskFormComponent` and the `TaskListComponent` are not connected.

We need a third party to manage the tasks and share them between the two components.
That's what Angular Services come in!

## Angular services

In Angular, a service is a class that can be used to share data and functionality across different parts of your application.
Services are used to encapsulate the logic that is not directly related to a specific component.
That's our situation: the tasks are not directly related to the `TaskFormComponent` or the `TaskListComponent`.

For the rest of this course, Angular services will be our main orchestration tool to retrieve, create, update and delete tasks.

The first goal will be to store the list to make it accessible from both components.
By default, Angular services are singletons. This means that there is only one instance of the service in the application.
As long as you do not refresh your application, the service will keep its memory.

As Angular routing does not refresh the page, the service will keep the list of tasks in memory by switching between the `TaskFormComponent` and the `TaskListComponent`.

## Create a service

To create a service in Angular, you can use the Angular CLI.
The `ng generate` command we used for components can also be used to generate services.

#### üéì Instructions

1. Run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
ng generate service task
```

This command will create a new file called `task.service.ts` in the `src/app` folder.

2. Open the `task.service.ts` file and add a property to store the list of tasks:

```typescript ins={"Import the task interface": 3-4} ins={"Add the tasks variable": 10-24}
// task.service.ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

import { Task } from './models/task.model';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class TaskService {

     tasks: Task[] = [
            {
                id: uuid(),
                title: 'Task 1',
                description: 'Description of task 1',
                createdAt: new Date()
            },
            {
                id: uuid(),
                title: 'Task 2',
                description: 'Description of task 2',
                createdAt: new Date()
            }
        ];
}
```

This list is exactly the one we used in the `TaskListComponent` to display the tasks.

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you learned

In this chapter, you learned how to create a service with Angular CLI.
Services are used to share data and functionality across different parts of your application.
Not only do they help to keep your code DRY, but they also help to keep your components clean and focused on their main purpose.
