At the time you submit the form, the **TaskFormComponent** task property is populated with the values you entered in the form.
For example, given you filled the name and description fields, the **task** will look like:

```typescript
task = {
  title: 'My new task',
  description: 'Awesome description'
};
```

Thanks to the last chapter, by submitting the form, you navigate away from the **TaskFormComponent** component.
When you navigate away from a component, the component is destroyed.

So by navigate once again to this form, the **task** property will be empty:

```typescript
task = {
  title: '',
  description: ''
};
```

A new instance of the **TaskFormComponent** component is created each time you navigate to it.
So any local state you set in the component is lost when you navigate away from it.

:::tip
That's why you store the new task in the **TaskService** service.
The service is a singleton, meaning it's a single instance shared across the application.
Except if you force reload the browser page, it'll keep the tasks you added in memory.
