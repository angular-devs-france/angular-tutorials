## Angular CLI

The **Angular CLI** is a command-line interface tool that you use to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications.  

You already used the CLI to serve the application locally with the `ng serve` command in the <a href="/practical-course/getting-started/#running-the-application" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> step.

Now it's time use it to create a new component.

#### Instructions

1. Open another terminal tab (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics" target="_blank">VSCode docs</a>).
2. Run the following command:

```bash
ng generate component task-list
```

3. You should see a new folder called `task-list` in the `src/app` folder.


:::note
This new folder contains the three following files:

- `task-list.component.ts`
- `task-list.component.html`
- `task-list.component.css`
:::

## Display the component

So far the application only displays the `app` component html content.  
Angular can't know on its own how and where you plan to use the `task-list` html content.

#### Instructions

1. Open the `src/app/app.component.html` file.
2. Add the task list selector as followed:

```html ins={"Add the task list selector and the main tag for styling and semantic purposes": 5-8}
// app.component.html
<header>
    <h1>Angular Practical course</h1>
</header>

<main class="container pt-4">
  <app-task-list />
</main>
```

3. Check out the changes in your browser.

<Image class="shadow-xl rounded-xl" src={creationImg} alt="A bird sitting on a nest of eggs."/>

:::tip
`task-list works!` is displayed in the browser.  
That's the default content generated by the Angular CLI in the component html file.
:::

## Component selector

The `app-task-list` is the component selector. It is used to tell Angular to render the `task-list` component in the `app` component.

The selector is a CSS selector that identifies this component in a template. Angular creates and displays an instance of the component wherever it finds the corresponding selector in the host HTML.

It's defined in the `task-list.component.ts` file:

```typescript "selector: 'app-task-list'"
// task-list.component.ts
@Component({
  selector: 'app-task-list',
  templateUrl: './task-list.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./task-list.component.css']
})
export class TaskListComponent {
}
```
