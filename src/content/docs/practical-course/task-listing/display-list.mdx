## HTML structure

To display a list of items, the expected HTML structure is:

```html
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">Item 1</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Item 2</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

<Image class="shadow-xl rounded-xl" src={staticImg} alt="A bird sitting on a nest of eggs."/>

However, what happens if we want to display a dynamic list of items changing over time?
What if a new task is added?

We want to rely on the `tasks` variable to display the proper list of tasks.
If the tasks is updated, the view should be updated as well.

## Angular Directives

Angular Components are Angular Directives with a template.
The goal of a Directive is not to display content but to manipulate the html content of an Angular component.
They can help to dynamically hide/display some content, change their style, or affect how many times a content is displayed.

### *ngFor directive

`*ngFor` name refers to **for loop**: its goal is to display a given html tag as many times as there are items in a provided list.
You can apply it on any html tag. It'll affect this tag and its children.

To use it, we add this `*ngFor` on the html tag and provide it an arbitrary syntax to define the list we want to iterate over and a reference to use the value of each item.
This syntax is `let item of items`:

- **items** refers to the list defined in your component.ts file.
- **item** is the reference to use the value of each item in the list (you can name it as you want).

```html
  <ul>
    <li *ngFor="let item of items"></li>
  </ul>
```

#### üéì Instructions

1. Open the `src/app/task-list.component.html` file.

2. Replace the content of the file with the following code:

```html
// task-list.component.html
<ul class="list-group">
  <li *ngFor="let task of tasks" class="list-group-item">
    Task
  </li>
</ul>
```

3. Go back to your browser and see the following page:

// TODO: Add image

Your list is now displayed in the browser.
You should see `Task` repeated as many times (2) as there are tasks in the list.

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you learned

In this chapter, you learned how to use a list of items defined in your component.ts file towards the component.html file.
You used the *ngFor directive to loop through the list of items and display them in the view.
Such a task is quite common in web development, and you'll likely use it in many of your Angular applications.
