Learn how to iterate over a list of items in a HTML template file using the *ngFor directive.

## HTML structure

To display a list of items, the expected HTML structure is:

```html
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">Item 1</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Item 2</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

<Image class="shadow-xl rounded-xl" src={staticImg} alt="A bird sitting on a nest of eggs."/>

However, what happens if we want to display a list of items that is dynamic and changes over time?
How to displays a four-item list today, but a five-item list tomorrow?

We want to use the `tasks` variable to display the list of tasks.
If the tasks is updated, the view should be updated as well.

## *ngFor directive

To display a list of items in an Angular application, you can use the `*ngFor` directive.
The `*ngFor` directive is a built-in directive that allows you to loop through a list of items and display them in the view.

By using it on an html tag, it'll display this tag and its children as many times as there are items in the list.

#### üéì Instructions

1. Open the `src/app/task-list.component.html` file.

2. Replace the content of the file with the following code:

```html
// task-list.component.html
<ul class="list-group">
  <li *ngFor="let task of tasks" class="list-group-item">
    Task name : 
  </li>
</ul>
```

3. Go back to your browser and see the following page:

// TODO: Add image

Your list is now displayed in the browser.
You should see `Task name :` repeated as many times as there are tasks in the list.

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you learned

In this chapter, you learned how to use a list of items defined in your component.ts file towards the component.html file.
You used the *ngFor directive to loop through the list of items and display them in the view.
Such a task is quite common in web development, and you'll likely use it in many of your Angular applications.
