Components are the building blocks of Angular applications.
Components are a solution to the problem of how to organize an application into smaller, reusable pieces.

Components are used to:

- Break up the application into smaller components.
- Reuse the same block in different parts of the application.
- as dedicated routes with their own URL.

:::note
If you are familiar with **components** with another frontend framework, the concept is the same.

## Our first component

Our project already has a default component called `app`.

It's made of 3 files:

- `app.component.ts`: The component class code, written in TypeScript.
- `app.component.html`: The component template, written in HTML.
- `app.component.css`: The component's private CSS styles.

Think about the human body:
- The HTML file is the bones,
- The TypeScript file is the brain and muscles, 
- The CSS file is the skin.

Each of these files is a part of the component.

Enterprise applications are made of many components. Each component is a piece of the application that controls a portion of the screen.
You'll learn how to create a new component in the next step.
