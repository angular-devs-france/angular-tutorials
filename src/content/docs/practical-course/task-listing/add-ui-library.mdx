Not specific to Angular, adding this library will improve the application's user interface rather than relying on default browser styles.

## What is a User Interface (UI) Library?

A user interface (UI) library is a collection of styled and reusable components. They can be used to create a user interface. This allows for creating a consistent appearance throughout the application and saves development time.

For this course, you will add <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> to your project.

## How to Add Bootstrap?

Rather than installing it directly and for ease of use, you will use an Angular library that wraps Bootstrap: <a href="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home" target="_blank">NG Bootstrap</a>.

The **NG-Bootstrap** installation command `ng add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap` will install Bootstrap as a dependency in your package.json file and add the necessary configuration to your project.

### 🎓 Instructions

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   ng add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap@16.0.0
   ```

2. Stop the server if it's still running (keyboard shortcut `CTRL+C`) and restart it with the following command:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

3. Open the `src/app/app.component.html` file and replace the content with the following code to add Bootstrap classes:

   ```html
   <header class="navbar bg-body-tertiary px-4">
     <h1 class="navbar-brand fw-bold">Angular Practical course</h1>
   </header>
   ```

4. Check out the _small_ changes in your browser.

   <Image
     class="shadow-xl rounded-xl"
     src={bootstrapImg}
     alt="A bird sitting on a nest of eggs."
   />

</Steps>

## ✔️ What You Have Learned

You have learned how to add a UI library to your Angular application.
Most Angular libraries use the `ng add` command to simplify the installation process. This avoids relying on the `npm install` command and additional manual updates to your project configuration.

In the upcoming chapters, you will use **Bootstrap** classes in HTML snippets to improve the application's user interface.
You won't need to explore the Bootstrap documentation as the snippets will be provided to you.

:::caution
**bootstrap** also refers to **application bootstrapping**.  
This is not the same as adding the Bootstrap UI library to your project.

Bootstrapping refers to the process of initializing an application. It's the process of loading a set of instructions that will be used to start the application.

For example, Angular uses the `src/main.ts` file to start the application. This file is the application's entry point. It's the first file executed when the application starts.

The `main.ts` file contains the following code:

```typescript
// main.ts
platformBrowserDynamic()
  .bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));
```
