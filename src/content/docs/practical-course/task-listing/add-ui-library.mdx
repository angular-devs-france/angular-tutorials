:::note
Learn how to add Bootstrap, an UI library, to your project to enhance the user interface of your application.
:::

Unrelated to Angular itself, adding this library will enhance the user interface of the application rather then relying on the default browser styles.

Here is a comparison of the complete application before and after adding the UI library:

## What is an UI library?

An UI library is a collection of reusable components that can be used to build a user interface. It can be used to build a complete application or to add specific features to an existing application.

To enhance the user interface of this application, we'll add <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> to our project.

## How to add Bootstrap

The Angular community created multiple projects to wrap Bootstrap to facilitate the installation.
We'll use the <a href="https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home" target="_blank">NG Bootstrap</a> one.

The **NG-Bootstrap** installation command will install Bootstrap as a dependency in your package.json file and add the necessary configuration to your project.

#### Instructions

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to install Bootstrap:

```bash
ng add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
```

2. Stop the server if it's running and restart it with the following command:

```bash
ng serve
```

3. Open the `src/app/app.component.html` file and replace the content with the following code to add Bootstrap classes:

```html
<header class="navbar bg-body-tertiary px-4">
    <h1 class="navbar-brand fw-bold">Angular Practical course</h1>
</header>
```

4. Check out the *small* changes in your browser.

## What you learned

You learned how to add an UI library to your project.  
The next chapters will use **Bootstrap** classes in html snippets to enhance the user interface of the application:

:::caution
**bootstrap** also refers to **bootstrapping an application**.  
This is not the same as adding the Bootstrap UI library to your project. 

Bootstrapping an application refers to the process of initializing an application. It is the process of loading a set of instructions that will be used to start the application.

For example, Angular uses the `src/main.ts` file to bootstrap the application. This file is the entry point of the application. It is the first file that is executed when the application starts.

The `main.ts` file contains the following code:

```typescript
// main.ts
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig).catch((err) =>
    console.error(err),
);
```
