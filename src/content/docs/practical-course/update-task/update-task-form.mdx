import Objective from '../../../../components/learning-objective.astro';

<Objective class="drop-shadow-xl" objectives={[
{title: 'Populate a form', description: 'Learn how to populate a form with the task to update.'},
]} />

We are now able to land on the `TaskFormComponent` when we click on the 'Update' link next to a task in the list with a new route path.
This path a dynamic value to pass the `id` of the task to update.

This `TaskFormComponent`form is currently empty as it was created to add a new task.
We'll update it so the form can be used both to create and update a task.

## Retrieve the task to update with the TaskService

Before retrieving the id from the route, let's prepare the logic to identify the task to update.
As the list of tasks is stored in the `TaskService`, we'll add a new function to retrieve a task based on its `id`.
From this id, we want to retrieve the whole task to fill the form.

#### üéì Instructions

1. Open the `src/app/task-service.ts` file.

2. Add the following code to the file:

```typescript ins={"Add a function to retrieve a taks based on its id": 29-33}
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Task } from './task.model';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class TaskService {
    tasks: Task[] = [
        {
            title: 'Task 1',
            description: 'Description of task 1',
            createdAt: new Date()
        },
        {
            title: 'Task 2',
            description: 'Description of task 2',
            createdAt: new Date()
        }
    ];

    addTask(task: Task): void {
        this.tasks.push({
            ...task,
            createdAt: new Date()
        });
    }

  
  getTask(id: string): Task {
    return this.tasks.find(task => task.id === id);
  }
}
```

## Retrieve the task id from the route

The `id` is present in the route path, we need to retrieve it in the `TaskFormComponent` component.
We'll use the `ActivatedRoute` service to retrieve the `id` from the route.

This service provides access to information about the current route.
Like we did with the `Router`, we'll inject it in the constructor of the `TaskFormComponent`.

### Angular lifecycle hooks

So far we initialized class properties when declaring them.

For example, we initialized the `task` property with an empty object:

```typescript
task = {
  id: '',
  title: '',
  description: ''
};
```

We cannot use such a logic to initialize the `task` property with the task to update.
When the class is created, the `id` is not available yet.

Why so?

From its creation to its destruction, a component goes through several stages.  
At the class creation of the Component stage, the route information is not available yet.

To handle such a case, Angular provides lifecycle hooks.
Lifecycle hooks are methods that Angular calls on components and directives as it creates, changes, and destroys them.

One of the most used lifecycle hooks is `ngOnInit`.
This hook is called after Angular has initialized all data-bound properties of a directive.
And at that time, the component is able to read the route information.

Inside this hook, we'll firstly retrieve the id from the route.
 The `route.snapshot` is a static image of the route information shortly after the component was created.
We can use it to retrieve the `id` from the route as it exposed a `paramMap` property.

This `paramMap` is a map of the required and optional parameters specific to the route, including dynamic route path parameters.
The `get` method of the `paramMap` object allows us to retrieve the value of a parameter basedon the name we used in the route path definition: `id`.

Let's sum up this part to the following code:

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
    const id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
}
```

:::tip
The `TaskFormComponent` is used both to create and update a task.
So by using it to create a task with the `add-task`route path, this code will not find any `id` in the route.
We'll need to encapsulate the following code in a condition so it runs only when the `id` is available in the route.
:::

Next, we'll retrieve the task to update from the `TaskService` based on the `id` available in the route.

```typescript
if (id) {
    this.task = this.taskService.getTask(id);
}
```

#### üéì Instructions

1. Open the `src/app/task-form/task-form.component.ts` file.

2. Add the following code to the file:

```typescript ins={"Retrieve the task id from the route": 10-13}
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
import { TaskService } from '../task.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-task-form',
  templateUrl: './task-form.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./task-form.component.css']
})
export class TaskFormComponent implements OnInit {
  task = {
    id: '',
    title: '',
    description: ''
  };

  constructor(private taskService: TaskService, private route: ActivatedRoute) {
  }
    
  ngOnInit() {
      const id = this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');

      if (id) {
          this.task = this.taskService.getTask(id);
      }
  }  
}
```

## Let's test it out

1. Click on the 'Update' button next to a task in the list.
2. The form should be populated with the task to update.

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you learned

In this chapter, you learned how to update the `TaskFormComponent` to populate the form with the task to update. You learned how to retrieve the task to update from the `TaskService` based on the `id` available in the route.
