## The route path

So far we defined 2 route paths:

- `''` for the `TaskListComponent` component to display the list of tasks
- `'add-task'` for the `AddTaskComponent` component to display a form

The update route path is quite different as we don't just want to land on a new page: to update a task, we need to know which task to update.

A common way to provide an information to a routed component is by using a dynamic route path.

## Create the route

Our new path will be `'update/:id'`.  
The `update` part is static but the `:id` part is dynamic.

:::tip
The `:id` part is a route parameter.
You can chain multiple route parameters in a path, for example `'update/:id/:name'`.
Each one is prefixed by a colon `:` followed by an arbitrary name.
:::

We won't create a dedicated component for the update feature.
The purpose of the `TaskFormComponent` is to create tasks with usr input: we'll update it to handle both creation and update.

#### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Open the `src/app/app-routing.module.ts` file.

2. Add the following code to the file:

   ```typescript ins={"1. Add the route for the update task feature": 9-10}
   import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
   import { RouterModule, Routes } from '@angular/router';
   import { TaskListComponent } from './task-list/task-list.component';
   import { TaskFormComponent } from './task-form/task-form.component';

   const routes: Routes = [
       { path: '', component: TaskListComponent },
       { path: 'add-task', component: TaskFormComponent },

       { path: 'update/:id', component: TaskFormComponent }
   ];

   @NgModule({
     imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
     exports: [RouterModule]
   })
   export class AppRoutingModule { }
   ```



</Steps>

## The update link

Let's add a link to the `TaskListComponent` to navigate to the `TaskFormComponent` with the `id` of the task to update.
By navigating to this path, you will extract the `id` value from the URL in the next chapter.

#### Instructions

<Steps>

1. Open the `src/app/task-list/task-list.component.html` file.

2. Add the following code to the file:

    ```html ins={"1. Add the update button": 4-5}
    <ul>
      <li *ngFor="let task of tasks; let i = index">
        Task name: {{ task.title }}

        <a [routerLink]="['/update', task.id]">Update</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    ```

</Steps>

The `routerLink` value expects a string or an array of URL segments.
The first one is a string, the static part of the path.
The second one is the `id` of the task to update.

## Let's test it out

<Steps>

1. Click on the 'Update' button next to a task in the list.
2. Check the URL:  `http://localhost:4200/update/1` for example.
3. The `TaskFormComponent` should be displayed.

</Steps>

## ‚úîÔ∏è What you learned

In this chapter, you learned how to add a route to update a task in an Angular application. You learned how to define a dynamic route path to pass the `id` of the task to update. You also learned how to use the `routerLink` directive to navigate to the `UpdateTaskComponent` and pass the `id` of
the task to update.
