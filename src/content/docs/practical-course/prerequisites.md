## Node installation

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

## Visual Studio Code

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.

### Installation

1. Download the Visual Studio Code installer from the [Visual Studio Code web site](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Run the installer (the .exe file you downloaded in the previous step.)
3. Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).
4. Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Visual Studio Code until you restart your computer.
5. Test Visual Studio Code. To see if Visual Studio Code is installed, open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or a similar command line tool, and type `code --version`. This should print a version number, so you’ll see something like this `1.35.1`.


### Plugins

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on the Extensions icon in the left side bar.
