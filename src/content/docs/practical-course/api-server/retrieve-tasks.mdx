## Update TaskService

The **HttpClient** service exposes several functions that allow you to make HTTP requests to a server. In this chapter, you'll use the **get** method to retrieve the task list from the API server.

:::note
**get** refers to **GET** requests in the HTTP protocol.
:::

This function takes the API server route path as a parameter: `http://localhost:3000/tasks`.
This is the URL it will query to get the list of tasks.

```typescript
getTasks(): Observable<Task[]> {
  return this.http.get<Task[]>('http://localhost:3000/tasks');
}
```

This new **getTasks** method defines the communication with the API server:

- It makes a **GET** request;
- It expects an array of **Task** objects in response;
- It communicates with the API server at the URL `http://localhost:3000/tasks`.

:::caution
The API will be responsible for retrieving the task list and you won't need the **tasks** variable in **TaskService** anymore.
However, since some code still depends on this variable, you'll need to keep it for now.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task.service.ts`.

   ```typescript ins={"Add the getTasks function": 24-27}
   import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
   import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";
   import { Task } from "./task.model";

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: "root",
   })
   export class TaskService {
     tasks: Task[] = [
       {
         id: "1",
         title: "First task",
         description: "This is the first task in your to-do list.",
       },
       {
         id: "2",
         title: "Second task",
         description: "This is the second task in your to-do list.",
       },
     ];

     constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

     getTasks(): Observable<Task[]> {
       return this.http.get<Task[]>("http://localhost:3000/tasks");
     }
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## Update TaskListComponent

Update **TaskListComponent** to use the new **getTasks** method and rename the **tasks** variable to **tasks$**. Adding `$` indicates that it's an Observable.

```typescript
tasks$ = this.taskService.getTasks();
```

Why? What is an observable?

**tasks** was an array of **Task** objects. Now, **tasks$** is an observable of an array of **Task** objects.

By calling the **getTasks** function, we get an Observable that will emit the list of tasks once received from the API server.
To differentiate an observable value, the Angular community commonly uses the `$` suffix in Angular applications.

:::note
An Observable **observes** a data stream.
:::

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the file `src/app/task-list/task-list.component.ts`.

   ```typescript del={"Remove the tasks variable": 11-12} ins={"Replace it with the tasks$ variable": 13-14}
   import { Component } from "@angular/core";
   import { TaskService } from "../task.service";
   import { Task } from "../task.model";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-task-list",
     templateUrl: "./task-list.component.html",
     styleUrls: ["./task-list.component.css"],
   })
   export class TaskListComponent {
     tasks: Task[] = this.taskService.tasks;

     tasks$ = this.taskService.getTasks();

     constructor(private taskService: TaskService) {}
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## Subscription

Calling the **getTasks** function won't trigger the API request immediately. Since it hasn't been triggered yet, the observable won't emit any values.
Trigger what we call a subscription to the observable to start the request.

:::tip
You **subscribe** to an observable like you would subscribe to a newspaper.
You request the latest issue of the newspaper. Only once it's available, it's delivered to you and you can read it.
:::

### How to subscribe?

There are several ways to subscribe to an observable.
For the given situation, use the **async** pipe in the HTML Template.

Like the **date** pipe used previously, the role of the **async** pipe is to transform data before displaying it.
Here its role will be to subscribe to the observable and return the list of tasks once available.

:::tip
Although alternatives exist, the **async** pipe is the recommended way to subscribe to an observable in the HTML Template.
You'll discover the alternative at the end of this page.
:::

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Modify the file `src/app/task-list/task-list.component.html`.

   ```html ins="tasks$ | async"
   <tr *ngFor="let task of tasks$ | async">
     <td>{{ task.title }}</td>
     <td>{{ task.createdAt | date }}</td>
     <td>
       <a class="btn btn-primary" [routerLink]="['/update', task.id]">Update</a>
       <button
         class="btn btn-danger"
         type="button"
         (click)="deleteTask(task.id)"
       >
         Delete
       </button>
     </td>
   </tr>
   ```

</Steps>

### Alternative

The alternative to using the **async** pipe is to subscribe to the observable in the component.

This is done by calling the **subscribe** function on the observable and passing a callback function as a parameter.
This callback will be made once the data is available.

This subscription will be used in the **ngOnInit** function of the **TaskListComponent** class.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Modify the file `src/app/task-list/task-list.component.ts`.

   ```typescript ins={"Subscribe to the observable": 14-17}
   import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
   import { TaskService } from "../task.service";
   import { Task } from "../task.model";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-task-list",
     templateUrl: "./task-list.component.html",
     styleUrls: ["./task-list.component.css"],
   })
   export class TaskListComponent implements OnInit {
     tasks: Task[] = this.taskService.tasks;

     constructor(private taskService: TaskService) {}

     ngOnInit() {
       this.taskService.getTasks().subscribe((tasks) => (this.tasks = tasks));
     }
   }
   ```

</Steps>

### Pitfalls

Although subscribing to the observable in the component is a valid solution, it lacks some optimizations provided by the **async** pipe.
It also requires more code for the same result.

Indeed, when you use the subscription to the observable in the component, you need to think about **unsubscribing**.
We won't cover this action for now. You can discuss with your mentor for more details.
