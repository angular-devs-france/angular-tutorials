In this chapter, you will learn how to create an API server with json-server and consume it in an Angular application.
In a real world scenario, the task list would be stored in a database and the application would consume an API to interact with the database.
It would not be stored in memory in a service as we did in the previous chapters.

## Json-server

To focus on the Angular part of the application, we will use json-server to create a simple API server.
It'll allow us to create, read, update and delete tasks.

As promoted on the json-server GitHub repository:
