## TaskService

Based on the HTTP protocol, you will use the **delete** function to remove a task from the list: **http.delete()**.
This function expects only one parameter, the URL of the resource to delete, including the **id** of the task to remove.

```typescript
deleteTask(task: Task) {
  return this.http.delete<Task>(`${http://localhost:3000/tasks/${task.id}}`);
}
```

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Modify the **task.service.ts** file.

   ```typescript ins={"Add the deleteTask function": 10-16}
   import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
   import { HttpClient } from "@angular/common/http";
   import { Task, TaskForm } from "./task.model";

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: "root",
   })
   export class TaskService {
     constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

     deleteTask(id: string) {
       return this.http.delete<Task>(`http://localhost:3000/tasks/${id}`);
     }
   }
   ```

</Steps>

## TaskFormComponent

Update **TaskFormComponent** to use this new function.
The simplest way to do this would be to apply the same logic as in the previous lesson, updating the **submit** function to make an API call and navigate to the list page.
This would result in the following code:

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Modify the `src/app/task-list/task-list.component.ts` file.

   ```typescript ins={"Modify the deleteTask function": 13-18}
   import { Component } from "@angular/core";
   import { TaskService } from "../task.service";

   @Component({
     selector: "app-task-list",
     templateUrl: "./task-list.component.html",
     styleUrls: ["./task-list.component.css"],
   })
   export class TaskListComponent {
     tasks$ = this.taskService.getTasks();

     constructor(private taskService: TaskService) {}

     deleteTask(id: string): void {
       this.taskService.deleteTask(id).subscribe(() => {
         document.location.reload();
       });
     }
   }
   ```

</Steps>

Following the same logic seen previously, we will wait for the request response to refresh the task list view.
