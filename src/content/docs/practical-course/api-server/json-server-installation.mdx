## What is json-server?

json-server is a small package that helps you to create a REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds.
It's a full fake REST API with zero coding that allows you to create, read, update and delete tasks.

It won't provide us a real API server, but it's a great tool to focus on the Angular part of the application.

Let's install it and create a fake database.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Run the following command in a terminal to Install json-server.

    ```bash
    npm install json-server
    ```
2. Create a `db.json` file at the project root and populate it with a list of tasks.

    ```json
    {
      "tasks": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "First task",
          "description": "This is the first task",
          "createdAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00"
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "title": "Second task",
          "description": "This is the second task",
          "createdAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
3. Create a `start-server` script in your `package.json` file.

    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "start-server": "json-server --watch db.json"
      }
    }
    ```
4. Run the following command to start json-server.

    ```bash
    npm run start-server
    ```
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/tasks`.
