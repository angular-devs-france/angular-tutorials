## The deleteTask function

To delete a task from the list, let's create a `deleteTask` function in the `TaskService` service.
It'll remove the task from the list based on its `uuid`.

### I🎓 nstructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/task.service.ts` file.

   ```typescript ins={"Add the deleteTask function": 20-23}
   import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: 'root'
   })
   export class TaskService {
       tasks: Task[] = [
           {
               title: 'Task 1',
               description: 'Description of task 1',
               createdAt: new Date()
           },
           {
               title: 'Task 2',
               description: 'Description of task 2',
               createdAt: new Date()
           }
       ];


     deleteTask(id: string) {
       this.tasks = this.tasks.filter(task => task.id !== id);
     }
   }
   ```

</Steps>
