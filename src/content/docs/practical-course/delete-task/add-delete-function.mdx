## The deleteTask function

To delete a task from the list, let's create a **deleteTask** function in the **TaskService**.
This function will remove the task from the list based on its **id**.

### 🎓 Instructions

<Steps>

1. Modify the file `src/app/task.service.ts`.

   ```typescript ins={"Adding the deleteTask function": 22-26}
   import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";

   @Injectable({
     providedIn: "root",
   })
   export class TaskService {
     tasks: Task[] = [
       {
         id: uuid(),
         title: "Task 1",
         description: "Description of task 1",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
       {
         id: uuid(),
         title: "Task 2",
         description: "Description of task 2",
         createdAt: new Date(),
       },
     ];

     deleteTask(id: string): void {
       const taskIndex = this.tasks.findIndex((task) => task.id === id);
       this.tasks.splice(taskIndex, 1);
     }
   }
   ```

</Steps>
