You just learned how to delete a task from the list, and we want to display a message when the list is empty.


## The *ngIf directive

To iterate over the tasks list, we used the `*ngFor` directive.
Known as a structural directive, it affects the layout by adding, removing, or manipulating elements in the DOM.

Another common structural directive is the `*ngIf` directive.
It allows you to conditionally display an element in the view.

By passing it a condition, the element its used one is displayed only when the condition is true.

### üéì Instructions

<Steps>

1. Update the `src/app/task-list.component.html` file.

   ```html ins={"1. Add a message when the tasks list is empty": 6-7}
   <ul>
     <li *ngFor="let task of tasks">
       Task name : {{ task.title }}
     </li>
   </ul>

   <p *ngIf="!tasks.length">No tasks to display</p>
   ```

</Steps>
