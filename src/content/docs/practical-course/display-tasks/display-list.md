## HTML structure

To display a list of items, the expected HTML structure is:

```html
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">Item 1</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Item 2</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

However, what happens if we want to display a list of items that is dynamic and changes over time?

We want to use the `tasks` variable to display the list of tasks.
If the tasks is updated, the view should be updated as well.

## *ngFor directive

To display a list of items in an Angular application, you can use the `*ngFor` directive.
The `*ngFor` directive is a built-in directive that allows you to loop through a list of items and display them in the view.

Open the `src/app/task-list.component.html` file.

Replace the content of the file with the following code:

```html
// task-list.component.html
<ul class="list-group">
  <li *ngFor="let task of tasks" class="list-group-item">
    Task name : 
  </li>
</ul>
```

Save the file.

Go back to your browser and refresh the page.

You should see the following page:

// TODO: Add image

Your list is now displayed in the browser.
You should see `Task name :` repeated as many times as there are tasks in the list.
