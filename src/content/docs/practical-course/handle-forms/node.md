Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

## Installation

### Windows

1. Download the Windows installer from the [Nodes.js® web site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Run the installer (the .msi file you downloaded in the previous step.)
3. Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).
4. Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Node.js until you restart your computer.
5. Test Node. To see if Node is installed, open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or a similar command line tool, and type `node -v`. This should print a version number, so you’ll see something like this `v0.10.35`.

### macOS

1. Download the macOS installer from the [Nodes.js® web site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Run the installer (the .pkg file you downloaded in the previous step.)
3. Follow the prompts in the installer (Accept the license agreement, click the NEXT button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings).
4. Restart your computer. You won’t be able to run Node.js until you restart your computer.
5. Test Node. To see if Node is installed, open the Terminal and type `node -v`. This should print a version number, so you’ll see something like this `v0.10.35`.

### Linux

1. Open your terminal and type `sudo apt-get install nodejs npm`.
2. Test Node. To see if Node is installed, open the Terminal and type `node -v`. This should print a version number, so you’ll see something like this `v0.10.35`.
